# Aerospect

## 💡 Inspiration

## 💻 What it does

Aerospect is an AR-based web platform where students come across and learn about various aircrafts. Learn with the help of interactive 3D Models and AR. Aerospect can help students achieve better results through visualization and full immersion in the subject matter.

## 🔨 How we built it

- React Js: For the frontend
- Three Js: For rendering 3D Models
- AssemblyAI: For speech to text

## 🤖 Best AssemblyAI Project

- We have used AssemblyAI for speech to text conversion.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

The biggest challenge was to rendering the 3D model and adding AR functionality to them, which I overcome using three js and echoAR.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

Completing the project under the given time frame

## 📖 What we learned

Working with three js and using echo3D

## 🚀 What's next for Aerospect

- Add Virtual Reality (VR) functionality
- Add more subjects and Customized 3D model
