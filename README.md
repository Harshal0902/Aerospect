## 💡 Inspiration
Aerospect is an AR-based web platform where students can visit the site and learn various concepts of Airplanes with the help of 3D Models, since many colleges and institutions can not provide a full scale aircrafts, especially for budding aerospace engineers. Students can use these 3D models to study, which makes their understanding easier, and faster. Aerospect can help students achieve better results through visualization and full immersion in the subject matter.

## 💻 What it does

Aerospect is an AR-based web platform where students come across and learn about various aircrafts. Learn with the help of interactive 3D Models and AR. Aerospect can help students achieve better results through visualization and full immersion in the subject matter.

## 🔨 How we built it

- React Js: For the frontend
- Three Js: For rendering 3D Models

## Prerequisites

Required to install and run the software:

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

## Installing and Running

From the project folder, run these commands in console (terminal) to install dependencies and run the app:

```
npm install
npm start
```

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

The biggest challenge was to rendering the 3D model and adding AR functionality to them, which we overcome using three js and echoAR.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

Completing the project under the given time frame

## 📖 What we learned

Working with three js and using echo3D

## 🚀 What's next for Aerospect

- Add Virtual Reality (VR) functionality
- Add more subjects and Customized 3D model
